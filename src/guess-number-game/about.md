# About the Guess Number Game
in this directory I will try to recreate a version of the "guess number game" seen in the book "[Realm of Racket](https://www.realmofracket.com/)" where it is being part of my support and learning about Racket, along with the official language documentation which is also amazing.

# Purpose of Game
is a simple game of guessing a number within a defined range, and the program will then figure out that number making guesses and asking the player if her number is bigger or smaller than the current guess.
