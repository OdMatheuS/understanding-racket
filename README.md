# Purpose
In this repository I want to add some of what I've been studying about the Racket programming language.
- Racket is member of the large family of Lisp languages, Lisp is also known for changing the way you think about programming


# Little about
Racket is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language in the lisp/scheme family. The language is used in a variety of contexts, such as scripting, general-purpose programming, computer science education, and research.
